# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
Analyzed COVID-19 data to provide vital insights for public health decision-making, employing statistical and machine learning techniques to track and visualize the pandemic's impact. Applied statistical methods and machine learning techniques to generate actionable recommendations for mitigating the pandemic's effects and improving public safety.

The repository is having a PDF in which all the codes with their analyzed graphs are mentioned. The other two files are the Covid Data table(a json) file and a .pynb file. In the PDF I picked up the data from the website and for the other one(.pynb), the data is picked from the excel table.
